# Sort an array of numbers

The challenge is to complete the function `getEvenIndexItems`, this function should take an array of items, returning all items at even indeces.

If there are no items within the array, simply return an array.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required..

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/get-even-index-items-from-an-array/get-even-index-items-from-an-array.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
