# Working with numbers - reverse it

The challenge is to complete the function `reverseANumber`, ensuring the function returns a number passed in to it, in reverse, so that 12345 would return 54321.

We will only be testing for positive integers for these tests, so don't worry about reversing negative numbers.

Numbers ending with 0 when reversed, will not begin with a 0, as leading 0's are removed from numbers.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required to `return` the reversed number.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/working-with-numbers-reverse-it/working-with-numbers-reverse-it.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 4 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
