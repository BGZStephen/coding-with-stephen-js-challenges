# Working with numbers - powers

The challenge is to complete the function `toThePowerOf`, ensuring the function returns the result of calculating the first argument to the power of the second argument. We only need to support integers of 0 and greater for this challenge.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required to `return` the number.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/entry/working-with-numbers-powers/working-with-numbers-powers.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 5 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
