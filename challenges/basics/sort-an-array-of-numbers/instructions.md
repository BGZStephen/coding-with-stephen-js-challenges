# Sort an array of numbers

The challenge is to complete the function `sortAnArray`, this function should take an array of integers, returning them sorted smallest to largest.

For the purpose of these tests, there will always be an array passed containing one or more integers.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required..

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/sort-an-array-of-numbers/sort-an-array-of-numbers.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.
