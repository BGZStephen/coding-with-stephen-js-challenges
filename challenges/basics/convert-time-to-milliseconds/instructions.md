# Convert time to milliseconds

The challenge is to complete the function `convertToMilliseconds`, this function should take 3 parameters, one four hours, one for minutes, one for seconds, returning the total time as a value in milliseconds. For the purpose of this tests, hours, minutes and seconds will always be an integer of 0 or greater.

Example: 0 hours, 0 minutes, 60 seconds would equal 60,000ms so should return 60000.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/convert-time-to-milliseconds/convert-time-to-milliseconds.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 5 passing tests.
