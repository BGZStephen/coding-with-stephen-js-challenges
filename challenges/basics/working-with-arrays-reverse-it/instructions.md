# Working with arrays - reverse it

The challenge is to complete the function `reverseAnArray`, ensuring the function returns an array of items passed in to it, in reverse, so that [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] would return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required to `return` the reversed array.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/working-with-arrays-reverse-it/working-with-arrays-reverse-it.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
