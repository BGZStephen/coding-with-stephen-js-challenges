# Invert the numbers

The challenge is to complete the function `invertTheNumbers`, this function should take a single parameter, an array of integers, returning an array containing the same numbers, inverted, meaning poitive numbers become negative, and vice-versa.

Example: [1, 2, -3, -4] should return [-1, -2, 3, 4].

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/invert-the-numbers/invert-the-numbers.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.
