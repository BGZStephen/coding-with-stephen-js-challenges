# Array contains item

The challenge is to complete the function `arrayContainsItem`. The function takes two arguments, an `array` and an `item`, the function should return true if the `item` exists within the array.

For the sake of this challenge, the item will only be a `string`, `number` or `boolean` type.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/array-contains-item/array-contains-item.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 6 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
