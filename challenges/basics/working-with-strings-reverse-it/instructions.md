# Working with strings - reverse it

The challenge is to complete the function `reverseAString`, ensuring the function returns a string passed in to it, in reverse, so that "abcdef" would return "fedcba".

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required to `return` the reversed string.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/entry/working-with-strings-reverse-it/working-with-strings-reverse-it.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
