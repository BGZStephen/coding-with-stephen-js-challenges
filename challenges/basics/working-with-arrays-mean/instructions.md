# Working with arrays - mean

The challenge is to complete the function `meanValueOfArray`, ensuring the function returns the result of mean value of the array.

The array will always contain a minimum of one positive integer.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required to `return` the mean of the array.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/working-with-arrays-mean/working-with-arrays-mean.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 5 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
