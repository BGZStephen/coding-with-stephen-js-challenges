# Uppercase or Lowercase

The challenge is to complete the function `toUpperOrLowerCase`, this function should take two arguments, the first being a string, and the second being either "upperCase" or lowerCase".

The function should return the string passed in to it, in upper case if the second argument is "upperCase" or lower case if the second argument is "lowerCase". 

If the second argument is neither "upperCase" or "lowerCase" simply return the string unchanged.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with the code required..

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/uppercase-or-lowercase/uppercase-or-lowercase.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 7 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
