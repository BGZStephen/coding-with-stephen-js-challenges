# Get middle item from an array

The challenge is to complete the function `getMiddleItem`. The function should return an array containing the middle item from an array of items. If the array contains an even number of items, then return the middle two items, if there are no matching elements, simply return an empty array.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/get-middle-item-from-array/get-middle-item-from-array.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
