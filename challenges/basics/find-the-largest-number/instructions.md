# Find the largest number

The challenge is to complete the function `findTheLargestNumber`, ensuring the function returns the largest number in a given array of numbers, for example, the argument of [1, 100, 1000] should return 1000.

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/basics/find-the-largest-number/find-the-largest-number.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 3 passing tests.
