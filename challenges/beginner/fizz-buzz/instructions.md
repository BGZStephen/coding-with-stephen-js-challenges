# Fizz Buzz

The challenge is to complete the function `fizzBuzz`, the function takes a single argument of a positive integer.

The function should return a line break delimeted string, accomplished by adding `\n` to represent a line break with the following logic applied on each number iterated to:

* If the number is divisible by 3, add to the string with `fizz\n`
* If the number is divisible by 5, add to the string with `buzz\n`
* If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, add to the string with `fizzbuzz\n`
* Else, add the number to the string with a line break, such as `8\n`

Fill in the code between the curly braces `{ }` with your solution.

Once you're happy, try running the tests with `npm run test challenges/beginner/fizz-buzz/fizz-buzz.test.js`, if you're all done, you should get a total of 5 passing tests.

Don't worry if you don't get it first try, here are some things to help out:
