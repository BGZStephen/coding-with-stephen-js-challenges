# Welcome to coding with Stephen

Hello, my name is Stephen, a software engineer from the UK, I've spent the last several years working for a variety of organisations, small and large, writing software and building scalable systems.

I've had the immense pleasure of working with and learning from some incredibly talented engineers, this is my means of paying it forward by helping those learning about software engineering, and those looking to up-skill in different areas.

Within this repo you'll find a set of JavaScript challenges inspired by numerous challenges I've undertaken over the course of my career to further my knowledge, these are going to be aimed at those with no experience, ranging up to those looking to take on moderately complex challenges, with accompanying videos detailing solutions on my [YouTube channel](youtube.com/channel/UCFBFlxUJ3ROGPiuLQG8D1kA).

For those new, I would recommend reading through the below sections on setting up your environment and installing the required software, so that when you're watching along, you can see exactly what I see.
